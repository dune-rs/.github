# Welcome to the Rust Dune Project 👋

🚀 **Reimagining the Stanford Dune Project in Rust**  
Our project aims to rewrite the [Stanford Dune Project](https://dune.scs.stanford.edu/) using the Rust programming language. By reimplementing Dune, we enable host processes to execute in the Ring-0 privilege level of virtual machines with enhanced safety and performance guarantees provided by Rust.

## 🏗️ What We're Building

- **Kernel Module in Rust**: A robust and secure reimplementation of the original kernel module.
- **libdune Library**: A library OS, rewritten in Rust, to interface with the kernel module and the user applications.
- **dune-sys Crate**: A user-friendly Rust crate providing an interface for interacting with the Dune environment.

This project blends cutting-edge virtualization concepts with Rust's safety and performance, making it a fresh take on the Dune framework.
